The increasing proportion of very old persons in Sweden means a higher prevalence of dementia. The majority of patients in traditional institutional long term care show cognitive deterioration. An insufficient caring situation, both in quantity and quality has long been observed. This, and a better knowledge and understanding of dementing diseases, their symptoms and consequences, has been the impetus to develop an alternative care model, group living (GL), for well defined groups of demented elderly. The concept of \{GL\} discussed here means a setting strictly adapted to the abilities and psychosocial needs of moderately diseased Alzheimer and vascular demented patients. Security, integrity promoting therapy and activation are specially stressed. The importance of informing and educating different kinds of actors simultaneously to structural changes in social and physical patterns within the implementation of the new concept is illustrated. "

Changes in behaviour and nursing dependency, and mortality rate were used as outcome variables. The main finding was that a large proportion of the sample showed significant depressive behaviour following transfer. A significant degree of disturbed behaviour and disorientation remained 3 months after the move. There was some increase in the mortality rate of the group transferred relative to a comparison group but this did not reach statistical significance.},

                  aging society. We believe that stewardship and the

                  when addressing the themes of well-being and quality
                  of life for future generations. This article
                  presents on overview of the usage of the concept
                  environment in aging studies and presents critically
                  important concepts such as sustainability,
                  stewardship, natural capital, carrying capacity, and
                  ecological footprint in recognizing the relevancy of
                  including the natural environment in discussions
                  about our aging society. Also we propose directions

                  organizational activities related to ecology and
