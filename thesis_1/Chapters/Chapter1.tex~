\section{Elderly Issue}
The commonly adopted boundary age for the elderly is 65 years old in
most of the developed counties~\cite{WHO2015}. From the 2010
U.S. census Demographic Profile Data, 13.1\% of the population are
over the age of 65. In Pittsburgh, this ratio is a little higher than
the nationwide statistics (\fref{fig:stat}, which is 13.8\% (42,151),
and 2.4\% (7347) of the population are of age over
85~\cite{censusQuickFact}. By 2030, 72.1 million (19\%) of the U.S will be elderly (65$+$)~\cite{AOA2015}

\section{Origin of the Project}

The awareness of the necessity for a senior community center near Carnegie Mellon University Campus emerged from my previous course project for Ecological Footprint in Fall 2013. In the analysis of the campus neighborhood, the conflict between  the relatively high ratio of senior population around campus and a lack of proper facilities for senior citizens was observed (\aref{AppendixA}).
\section{Proposed Site}
\subsection{Surrounding Buildings}
The proposed site of the senior center is to the north of the CMU campus next to Doherty Apartment across Forbes Ave. which is currently a parking lot (\fref{fig:siteLocation}). To the north of the proposed site is the East Campus Parking Garage. To the west of the site lie the alumni house and the Fraternity/Sorority Quadrangle. Doherty Appartment is to the east of the proposed site (\fref{fig:surroundingBd}).

\subsection{Neighborhood Context}
The proposed Senior Community Center is to the north of Carnegie Mellon University, and is within the boundary of the Squirrelhill North Neighborhood (\fref{fig:neighborhood}), which contains the majority portion of the CMU campus. The remaining portion of the campus is within the North Oakland neighborhood. The population density of the Squirrelhill North Neighborhood is 9713 person per square mile, much higher than Pittsburgh average (5532). The neighborhood has a median household income of \$82,214, over twice of that of the Pittsburgh (\$35,947). The average household size is 2.1, the single-mother households is only 4.2\%, dramatically lower than 21.8\% of Pittsburgh average. There are 16\% of foreign born residents. The area has a much higher percentage of higher education attainment as a result of the presence of Carnegie Mellon University.~\cite{neighborhood} (\tref{tab:neighborStat})
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2in}|c c c c}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Neighborhood Statistics}
\label{tab:neighborStat}
\end{table}

Average number of cars or other vehicles in the neighborhood is 1.8. The average estimated housing value (2010) for detached houses are \$516,844, which is four times that of the Pittsburgh average of \$132,337. The neighborhood is older than Pittsburgh average in terms of building built year. Most of the residents have a travel time of below 30 min. The majority of households in this are use gas to heat their house.The median rent is \$1,123, which is also a lot higher than \$603 of Pittsburgh in genera. This rent price is comparable to that of the renter occupied median housing cost in Stanford, which indicates the necessity to provide housing for the newly recruited faculty members (\tref{tab:midHousingcost}).

\subsection{Historic Aspect}
The site is vacant in 1900, from the history map in 1904, we can see a brick structured building was present and the building belongs to M.C Shiller. In 1959, Doherty Apartments is built [8] and has been functioning ever since. This indicates there are no major historic context needed to be reflected in the project design (\fref{fig:history}).

\end{figure}
\subsection{Physical Condition}
There is an elevation between the south and the north of the proposed site. The north side is about 10m higher than that of the south.
\section{Previous Design Conducted}
Ms. Anne-Marie Lubenau has completed a design of a senior center on this site (~\fref{fig:prevDesign}). The general form of the building consists of four major component: three major living component and one public component. Each of the four component is easily identified with the hipped roof above it. The public component locate on the southwestern of the site and the remaining three living component locate on the southeastern, northeaster and northwestern corner of the building.

The public component consists of a public library, a group kitchen, a lounge on the first floor, a computer cluster, a health suite on the second floor and some mechanical rooms and storage rooms in the basement. Each of the living component consists of 6 living unit per floor except the first floor of the northeastern living component consists only 4 living units. There are in total 54 living units in the building. Between each of the adjacent component, there are some lobby or lounge area. The vertical transportation located in the center of each of the four component. There are 30 parking spot located in the basement with the entrance on the northeastern corner of the site.

\section{Climate}
The site located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is within the climate zone 5A, with 5957 Heating Degree Day (HDD) of 65 $\deg F$ and 5009 Cooling Degree Day (CDD) of 74 $\deg$ F. The design heating temperature is 8 $\deg F$ and design cooling temperature is 86 $\deg F$~\cite{remrate}
\section{Role of the Project}
\subsection{Bridge of Conversation between Different Age Group}
As is addressed by Neyfakh~\cite{Neyfakh2014}, American society is confronted by severe age segregation, people are hashed into different ``buckets'' of ages groups and their social life is restricted to their own ``bucket''. Study had shown that no more than 1/4 of the conversation about ``important matters'' happen between the elderly and people younger than 36; by excluding relatives, the figure dropped to 6\%. Age segregation ``sow distrust and prejudice between generations, and robs people of the chance to learn from those younger and older than them''. 
The elderly benefit from reading to children and children or the young people can learn the life knowledge from the elderly.

One of the major focus of this project is to establish a connection between different age groups. The role of architecture in providing good quality of life for the elderly is far more than just plugging in assisted living facilities and add some space for instant medical care. It is also about creating chances of meeting new people and about maintain the link to the society.

\subsubsection{Creating Connections between the Elderly and Children}
One of the elderly friend of Prof. Hartkopf shared his experience of encountering children in their field trip. Children are the only people that has the will to touch the elderly apart from the doctors that give them a shot of drug when they get sick. The age group is respected for their rich experiences along the development of mankind, but is suffering from a segregation as a side-effect of the development of the modern society. 

The presence of a children’s school and the Academy of Lifelong Learning (\href{http://www.cmu.edu/osher/}{OSHER}) on campus enables the possibility to create a connection between the life of senior citizens and the early education of the children in the children's school. 

Through the discussion with the administrators of the \href{http://www.psy.cmu.edu/cs/}{children's school} of Carnegie Mellon University, Ms. \href{http://www.psy.cmu.edu/cs/people/carver.html}{Sharon Carver}, Director of Children's School, and Ms. \href{http://www.psy.cmu.edu/cs/people/drash.html}{Allison Drash}, the Administrative Coordinator, I acquired a lot of insights about different approaches about how children and elderly can be related.
\subsubsection{Creating Connections between Elderly and Student}
The proposed site is to the east of a student apartment, Doherty Apartment. The design of a common space on roof level of the senior center and the bridge from the senior center to the garage might become a common route for both the elderly and the young colledge students, which might be able to create interactions between the age group of the elderly and young students.

Another approach to create the connections between these two age groups is through some volunteering programs where the students can providing some health or activity related services and the elderly can also volunteer to participated in some of the study project of students, especially in aging related areas.

``Lunchtime Walking Buddy'' can be an example of how volunteering opportunities can facilitate the connection between the two age groups. The path between the proposed site of the senior community center and the classroom of Lifelong Learning and the Children's School will bypass the playground. Track walking is an easy and effective way of exercise for the elderly and the young. The problem for the elderly is they might encounter sudden fall while exercising. The volunteering lunchtime walking will benefit the elderly by allowing a supervised safer exercise for the elderly and it will benefit the young by providing them with the chance of conversation with people of rich life experiences.

Yet another approach is through providing some well designed common spaces. For example, the common space on the top level of the senior center could provide a nice study space and the basement will contain some extra music practicing rooms which might attract young student to come and use, and thus creating chances for the young and old to meet.
\subsection{Center for Geriatrics (Aging Related) Researches}
There are several geriatrics research groups in or around Carnegie Mellon University. The creation of such a center near campus can provide more interactions and hands-on experience with their research target and thus might become a pushing force for the development of the related researches.
\subsubsection{Connections to Quality of Life Technology (QoLT) Center}
The focus of the QoLT center is ``intelligent systems that improve
quality of life for everyone while enabling older adults and people
with disabilities''~\cite{QoLT2014}. One of the promising research branch
of the QoLT center that facilitates the connection to the Seniro
Center is one of the four Testbed Systems: the Home and Community
Health \& Wellness (HCHW), whose goal is described as ``The goals of
the Home and Community Health \& Wellness (HCHW) testbed systems are
to create and evaluate home and community-based solutions for
assessing everyday functional status, providing appropriate feedback,
and assisting rehabilitation in the natural environment for people
with reduced capabilities due to disability or aging.  HCHW systems
will enable more older adults and people with disabilities to live
independently. ''~\cite{HCHW}

The following are some project carried on by the HCHW system:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Health Kiosk\\
	The Health Kiosk system allows the elderly to track and record their health conditions including ``blood pressure, blood oxygen level, handgrip, weight, hearing'' etc. and remotely send the results to clinicians without an actual clinical visit. It provides senior citizens with easy monitoring and knowledge of their health conditions on a regular basis (~\fref{fig:kiosk})~\cite{Kiosk}.

		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{kiosk.png}
	\caption[Health Kiosk]{Health Kiosk~\cite{Kiosk}}
	\label{fig:kiosk}
\end{figure}
	\item Embedded Assessment of Wellness with Smart Home Sensors\\
	The system helps to monitor the abilities of senior citizens in performing everyday activities and provides information of the degree of physical ability declination.~\cite{Lee:2010:EAW:1864431.1864490} 
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Community Center for the Elderly and Other Residents}
Although the proposed senior center will contain some amount of living units to the elderlies with various degree of assistance: from the active independent elderly, to those need intensive assistance to those with special needs of assistance (Alzheimer Disease) even the ``end-of-life" issue. One of the important roles of the center is to act as a community gathering space dedicated for the surrounding neighborhood. 
\subsection{Demonstration of Advanced Building Technology and System Design}
\subsubsection{Urban Agriculture}
Gardening / Horticulture is one of the shared activities of almost all age groups . It can create food, jobs and a chance of meeting and mixing of different age groups. Possible approaches of the project on Urban Agriculture include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Create Roof Gardens on the top floor of the parking garage and part of the Senior Community Center
\item Create Vegetation facade for the Senior Community Center
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Sustainable / Renewable Energy Source}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solar Energy for electricity: 
1-1) Integration of PV panels and green roofs.
1-2) Integration of PV panels and shading devices
\item Geothermal
\item Co-generation system within the building groups
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Passive Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design of building orientation and dimension of space to facilitate day-lighting and natural ventilation
\item Rainwater collection and reuse
\item Phase-changing material
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Pre-fabrication of Building Components}
\subsubsection{Intelligent Building Control System}
\subsubsection{Strategies for Maximizing the Indoor Environment Quality}
\begin{itemize}
 %﻿Water-based heating and cooling system﻿ to% ensure both the energy performance and the acoustic quality of the indoor environment.
\item Water-based heating and cooling system to ensure both the energ performance and the acoustic quality of the indoor environment 
\item Floor-based mechanical system to ensure low pollutant concentration and space flexibility  
\item Transparent space boundary design to allow views to indoor and outdoor activities and to create spatial guidance for the elderly.
\item Installing Personal Environment Module to account for stricter environment requirement from the elderly.

\section{Design Choices and Concerns for Children and Elderly}
\subsection{Integrated Learning Opportunities}
\subsubsection{Dalcroze Eurhythmics}
Music is a common activity shared by all age groups including the elderly and the young children. It is not only a delight for life but also a effective training for brain and physical dexterity development for children and the function maintenance of the elderly. One of such example is the Dalcroze Eurhythmics. It teaches music concepts through body movements.

Eurhythmics is a good candidate for creating common activities between the elderly and the children because: 1) it involves plenty of body movement which can be game-like for children and can be good exercise for the elderly 2) Marta Sanchez Dalcroze Training Center in Carnegie Mellon University has a high quality education in Dalcroze Eurhythmics that offers classes for both the children and the elderly.
\subsubsection{Elderly Reading to Children}
A nursing home in Tulsa, Grace Living Center has a collaboration with the Jenks public school. The facility provids two classrooms for 60 kindergarton students  of grade 1 and 2 and preschool students. The elderly residents in the center can volunteer to become mentors for the children that assists children in both acadamic and social development. Children brought joy in elderly's life, and the elderly provided acadamic improvement for children. The Jenks school found that ``a smaller percentage of students from the GLC have required reading intervention'' in their later studies. One example of the collaborated learning is the ``book buddies'' activities, where children and elderly form groups and read to each other severa times per week. Another example is the ``shared study'', where the elderly and the children work on craft activities together such as making Christmas ornaments, scarecrows etc. There are also comparative course content when the elderly and children share their lifes of ``then and now'' \cite{Morehouse2009}.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Horticulture}
The term ``gray and green'', introduced by Wright and
Lund, means the positive effect of introducing
green plants on the process of aging. Gardening reduces stress,
nurtures stewardship~\cite{Wright2000229}. Gardening activities is one
of the common activities that benifit both the children and the
elderly. The ``edible garden'' is mentioned by Tai et al.\ in the book
Designing Outdoor Environments for Children. Edible gardens can let
children experience the whole gardening process from growing to
harvest, promote physical activities and also teach children the
knowledge of healthy eating, which contributes to the battle towards
childhood obesity in the U.S~\cite{Tai2006}, which shortens children's
lifespan expectancy by five years~\cite{Souterbrown2015}. They also mentioned a
type of ``music garden'', where outdoor music instrument are
incorporated in the design of garden environment.

Green space can also act as a healing and conforting power. There are
two major types of such salutogenicly designed gardens: the ``healing
or sensory garden'' that provide passive assist to imporve healthy
conditions. ~\cite{Souterbrown2015}. The ``Healing Gardens'' aims at
providing a quiet and calming space away from urban environment noise,
where ``young and old can escape and emotionally revitalise''. The
``Sensory Garden'' provide a ways to open up the senses of visitors{:
visually, acoustically, variety in scents, tastes and touching
experiences. ``Therapeutic Gardens'' actively conduct healing
operations. There are specific therapeutic gardens for people with
dememtia or mobility problem. A common feature of such therapeutic
gardens is raised bed, which is accessible for people in a wheel
chair.

\subsection{Mobility Issue}
The mobility is a big issue that needs to be seriously dealt with for
the two age groups to meet and have common activities. The elevation
difference, staircases and busy roads can all potentially become
barriers that prevents them from using the path we
designed. Especially for children, in order to reach the proposed site
of the senior center, they have to cross Forbes Ave. According to the
safety requirement, the children need to cross the street with the
presence of traffic lights, so the possible places to cross are either
the crossing at Forbes and Beeler or at Forbes and Morewood. Such
detouring can increase the travel distance and may cause the failure
of establishing such a connection, especially when there are not
enough cleaning and resting facilities as chairs and bathrooms along
the path.

The presence of university center along the path is a great help. Since the building itself is already a well functioned and energetic gathering space that provides abundant cleaning and resting spaces. 

One of the desired solution for the detouring and the crossing of Forbes Ave. is to create a bridge that directly connects the university center and the senior center. This solution can both shorten the distance and fulfill the required services along the path. But from the location of the University Center and the proposed site, the bridge directly connecting both will be too long to construct. So instead I propose to connect the parking garage with the senior center. This bridge may not only act as a safe cross for the senior people, children as well as the students living in Doherty Apartment, but also an identification of the entrance to the campus zone. 

The parking garage needs to be retrofitted so that it will not become an unpleasant spot along the route that only creates noise and exhaust gas, but a great view. This will be further discussed in the section of the proposed design of the plants and green space in the senior center and along the path between senior center and children school.
