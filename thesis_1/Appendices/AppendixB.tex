\section{introduction}
The session records the data source and process of using GIS to
conduct the analysis of senior population concentration and existing
senior center.
\section{Process}
\subsection{Building Base Map and Acquiring Geographic Data}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download Block Group shapefile from Census Bureau
\item Adding the Glock Group layer to the map file
\item Download user tools for retrieving data from the two zip file above~\url{http://www2.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/}
\item Create a gdb folder ``cmu.gdb'' for this assignment and put all related files inside that folder
\item Import the table to the gdb folder
\item Create three new field in attribute table of ``PABlkGrp'':
``senior\_mal''e for male population of above 65 years old,
``senior\_female'' for female population of above 65 years old, one
``totalPopu'' for the total population within a block group.
Join the population table to the layer ``PABlkGrp''
\item Copy and retain the senior population and total population data then remove join
\item Change the projection of the layer of ``PABlkGrp'' from GCS to ``NAD\_1983\_StatePlane\_Pennsylvania\_South\_FIPS\_3702\_Feet'' using Geoprocessing -> Projection and transformation -> Project
\item Calculate senior people percentage over total population with field calculation: [SeniorPopu] / [TotalPopu]
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Using Geocoding to Add Senior Centers to the Map}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download table of senior center addresses as a csv file
\item Import the csv file to the cmu.gdb database
\item Use the ``geocoding'' tool in ArcGIS to project the locations of
  senior center to the map as a layer of point features
\item Create a 0.3 mile buffer around the point in the address layer.
\end{enumerate}
