\section{introduction}
The session records the data source and process of using GIS to conduct the analysis of senior population concentration and existing senior center.
\subsection{Building Base Map_ Acquiring Geographic Data}
Download Block Group shapefile from Census Bureau\\ 
Adding the Glock Group layer to the map file\\
Download user tools for retrieving data from the two zip file above~\url{http://www2.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/}\\
Create a gdb folder “cmu.gdb” for this assignment and put all related files inside that folder\\
Import the table to the gdb folder\\
Create three new field in attribute table of “PABlkGrp”: "senior_male" for male population of above 65 years old, "senior_female" for female population of above 65 years old, one “totalPopu” for the total population within a block group.
Join the population table to the layer “PABlkGrp”\\
Copy and retain the senior population and total population data then remove join\\
Change the projection of the layer of “PABlkGrp” from GCS to “NAD\_1983\_StatePlane_Pennsylvania_South_FIPS_3702_Feet” using Geoprocessing -> Projection and transformation -> Project\\
	Calculate senior people percentage over total population with field calculation: [SeniorPopu] / [TotalPopu]\\
