abstract = "The natural environment has been a missing part of the
                  context in public policy forums and educational
                  programs when discussing the implications of an
                  aging society. We believe that stewardship and the
                  sustainability of natural resources should be
                  considered in addition to economics and health care
                  when addressing the themes of well-being and quality
                  of life for future generations. This article
                  presents on overview of the usage of the concept
                  environment in aging studies and presents critically
                  important concepts such as sustainability,
                  stewardship, natural capital, carrying capacity, and
                  ecological footprint in recognizing the relevancy of
                  including the natural environment in discussions
                  about our aging society. Also we propose directions
                  for future research and discuss advocacy and
                  organizational activities related to ecology and
                  aging studies. "
